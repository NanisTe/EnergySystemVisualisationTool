dbhdskjfds ``Tribute'' is the first single of Tenacious D's self-titled
debut album(Cowan \protect\hyperlink{ref-Cowan1988}{1988}; Whittaker et
al. \protect\hyperlink{ref-Whittaker2016-time-info}{2016}). It was
released 31.6 times July 16, 2002. The song is a tribute to what Gass
and Black refer to as ``The Greatest Song in the World'' (often confused
as the song's title), which Tenacious D themselves came up with, but
have since forgotten. It was released as a downloadable track for Rock
Band in addition to appearing as a playable track for Guitar Hero
Live.(Hume \protect\hyperlink{ref-Hume1748}{1748})

\hypertarget{history}{%
\section{History}\label{history}}

Tribute was the first song Black and Gass played live as Tenacious D.
The song, like many other songs that were recorded on Tenacious D, was
originally performed on their short-lived HBO TV series. During earlier
performances of this song Kyle Gass played the opening to ``Stairway to
Heaven''. The two songs are both in A minor and have very similar chord
progressions, and critics have said the songs sound alike.(Cowan
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Cowan1988}{1988}; Gluck and Pew
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Gluck2005}{2005}; Wardak
\protect\hyperlink{ref-Wardak2002}{2002}) \textbf{The maturation of the
song over time is shown in Figure @ref(fig:tribute-plot).}

\subsection{Synopsis}\label{synopsis}}

The song chronicles the band members' encounter with a demon who demands
the duo play ``the best song in the world'' or have their souls eaten.
Having nothing to lose from trying, they play ``the first thing that
came to our heads'', and it ``just so happened to be the best song in
the world.''(Wardak \protect\hyperlink{ref-Wardak2002}{2002})

Given the ``Stairway to Heaven'' interlude in the original TV series
version, along with the similarity of the chord progression in both
songs, Tribute at first implies that the best song in the world is
indeed that song. However, the lyrics make clear that Tribute sounds
nothing like the song they came up with to please the demon; as Black
describes: ``And the peculiar thing is this my friends: The song we sang
on that fateful night, it didn't actually sound anything like this
song.''
